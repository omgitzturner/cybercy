-- Track 1: Phishing
('Recognizing Phishing Attacks', 'phishing', 20, 1,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"What Is Phishing?","body":"Phishing is a form of social engineering where attackers impersonate trusted entities via email, SMS, or fake websites to steal credentials, financial data, or install malware. Campaigns are highly targeted and increasingly convincing."},{"title":"Common Warning Signs","body":"Look for misspelled sender domains (e.g. ''paypa1.com''), urgent language demanding immediate action, generic greetings like ''Dear Customer'', and links whose hover-URL does not match the displayed text. Attachments from unknown senders should always be treated with suspicion."}],"summary_prompt":"Describe three specific warning signs you would look for in a suspected phishing email and explain why each is significant."}'
),
('Identifying Spoofed Emails', 'phishing', 15, 2,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Email Spoofing Explained","body":"Attackers forge the ''From'' field of an email to make it appear to originate from a trusted source. Inspecting the raw message headers reveals the true originating IP and mail server, exposing the deception."},{"title":"Using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC","body":"SPF authorises which mail servers may send on behalf of a domain. DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to each message. DMARC ties these together and instructs receiving servers on how to handle failures. Together they drastically reduce spoofing success rates."}],"summary_prompt":"Explain how you would verify whether an email is genuinely from your company''s domain using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records."}'
),
('Safe Email Practices', 'phishing', 20, 3,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Think Before You Click","body":"Hover over any hyperlink before clicking to preview the destination URL. When in doubt, navigate directly to the website via your browser instead of following email links. Never enter credentials on a page reached through an unsolicited email."},{"title":"Handling Attachments Securely","body":"Enable macro execution warnings in Microsoft Office. Open attachments from unknown senders inside a sandboxed environment or online scanner. Compress and password-protect sensitive files before emailing, and share the password via a separate channel."}],"summary_prompt":"Outline a personal checklist of at least four steps you will take every time you receive an unexpected email containing a link or attachment."}'
),
('Reporting Suspicious Emails', 'phishing', 10, 4,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Why Reporting Matters","body":"Every unreported phishing attempt gives attackers data on what succeeds. Prompt reporting enables the security team to block malicious domains, warn colleagues, and improve filters before others fall victim."},{"title":"How to Report","body":"Use the built-in ''Report Phishing'' button in your email client. Forward suspicious messages as an attachment (not inline) to security@company.com. Include the full headers and any context about why you found it suspicious. Never forward phishing emails to colleagues as a warning — use official channels instead."}],"summary_prompt":"Write a step-by-step guide you would share with a new colleague explaining exactly how to report a suspicious email in our organisation."}'
),

-- Track 2: Passwords
('Creating Strong Passwords', 'passwords', 20, 1,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Password Strength Fundamentals","body":"A strong password is long (16+ characters), unpredictable, and unique to every account. Using a passphrase — four or more random words joined together — is both memorable and highly resistant to brute-force attacks. Avoid dictionary words, dates, or personal information."},{"title":"Checking Your Password Strength","body":"Tools such as ''Have I Been Pwned'' let you check whether a password has appeared in known data breaches without exposing the full password. Many password managers include built-in strength meters. Aim for an entropy of at least 60 bits."}],"summary_prompt":"Generate an example strong passphrase, explain your method for creating it, and describe how you would remember it without writing it down insecurely."}'
),
('Password Storage Best Practices', 'passwords', 15, 2,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Why Password Managers Are Essential","body":"Reusing passwords is the single biggest account-security mistake. A dedicated password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, KeePassXC) generates, stores, and auto-fills unique credentials for every site. Your master password and a hardware security key are the only things you need to remember."},{"title":"Secure Storage on the Backend","body":"Systems should never store plain-text passwords. The correct approach is to hash passwords with a modern, slow algorithm such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2id with an appropriate work factor and a per-user salt. MD5 and SHA-1 are not acceptable for password storage."}],"summary_prompt":"Compare storing passwords in plain text, with MD5, and with bcrypt. Explain the risks of each approach and why bcrypt (or similar) is the recommended choice."}'
),
('Multi-Factor Authentication', 'passwords', 20, 3,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"What Is MFA?","body":"Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide two or more independent proofs of identity: something you know (password), something you have (authenticator app or hardware key), and something you are (biometrics). Even if a password is compromised, MFA prevents unauthorised access."},{"title":"Choosing the Right Second Factor","body":"TOTP apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) are significantly more secure than SMS OTPs, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping. Hardware security keys (YubiKey, FIDO2) are the gold standard. Avoid security questions — they are effectively a second, weaker password."}],"summary_prompt":"Explain why SMS-based two-factor authentication is considered weaker than TOTP or hardware keys, and describe a scenario where each weakness could be exploited."}'
),
('Password Reset Procedures', 'passwords', 10, 4,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Secure Reset Flow","body":"A secure password reset sends a time-limited, single-use token to a verified email or phone. The token should expire within 15–60 minutes and be invalidated immediately after use. The reset page must be served over HTTPS and should not leak whether an email address exists in the system."},{"title":"Common Pitfalls","body":"Security questions are easily guessable or researched via social media. Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is deprecated by NIST. Never reset a password over the phone without robust identity verification. Always log and alert on password reset attempts for security monitoring."}],"summary_prompt":"Design a secure password reset flow for a web application. Identify at least three security controls you would implement and explain the threat each control mitigates."}'
),

-- Track 3: Data Protection
('Classifying Data', 'data_protection', 20, 1,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Why Data Classification Matters","body":"Not all data carries equal risk. A classification policy assigns every piece of information a sensitivity tier — typically Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted — so employees know how to handle, store, share, and dispose of it appropriately."},{"title":"Classification in Practice","body":"Label documents with their classification in the header/footer. Store Restricted data only on approved, encrypted systems. Avoid emailing Confidential data without encryption. Review classifications periodically — data sensitivity often changes over time (e.g. after a product launch or legal proceedings conclude)."}],"summary_prompt":"Describe how you would classify three real-world data types found in our organisation and explain the handling requirements for each classification tier."}'
),
('Secure Data Handling', 'data_protection', 20, 2,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Data in Transit","body":"All sensitive data transmitted over a network must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. Avoid unencrypted protocols (HTTP, FTP, Telnet). Use a VPN when accessing company resources from untrusted networks. Encrypted email (S/MIME or PGP) should be used for sharing Restricted information externally."},{"title":"Data at Rest","body":"Laptops and removable media must use full-disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault, LUKS). Databases storing sensitive information should use column-level encryption for the most critical fields. Cloud storage must be configured with appropriate access controls and server-side encryption enabled."}],"summary_prompt":"A colleague asks you to email them a spreadsheet containing employee salary information. Describe every step you would take to handle this request securely."}'
),
('Encryption Basics', 'data_protection', 25, 3,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption","body":"Symmetric encryption (AES-256) uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data — it is fast and ideal for bulk data. Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt — it solves the key-distribution problem and underpins TLS and email encryption."},{"title":"How TLS Works","body":"TLS performs a handshake: the server presents its certificate, the client verifies it against a trusted CA, and both parties negotiate a shared symmetric session key using asymmetric cryptography. All subsequent communication uses the faster symmetric key. Certificate pinning can further protect against man-in-the-middle attacks."}],"summary_prompt":"Explain in plain language how HTTPS protects your data when you log into a website, covering certificate verification, key exchange, and data encryption."}'
),
('Data Breach Response', 'data_protection', 15, 4,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Identifying a Breach","body":"Indicators of a breach include unusual account activity, unexpected data exports, alerts from DLP tools, ransom notes, or reports from external parties. Speed of detection is critical — the longer a breach goes undetected the greater the damage and regulatory exposure."},{"title":"Responding to a Breach","body":"Follow your Incident Response Plan: contain the breach (isolate affected systems), assess the scope, notify the Data Protection Officer within the required timeframe (72 hours under GDPR), preserve forensic evidence, remediate the root cause, and conduct a post-incident review. Never attempt a cover-up — regulatory penalties for concealment far exceed those for prompt disclosure."}],"summary_prompt":"Draft a brief incident report template for a data breach that includes: discovery timeline, data types affected, containment actions taken, and notification obligations."}'
),

-- Track 4: Social Engineering
('Understanding Social Engineering', 'social_engineering', 20, 1,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"The Human Firewall","body":"Social engineering exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers manipulate targets using trust, authority, urgency, fear, or reciprocity to bypass even the most sophisticated technical defences. Security awareness training is the primary defence."},{"title":"Common Attack Types","body":"Phishing (email), vishing (voice/phone), smishing (SMS), tailgating (physical), and watering-hole attacks (compromised websites frequented by targets) are the most prevalent forms. Spear-phishing targets specific individuals using personalised information gathered from social media."}],"summary_prompt":"Describe a realistic social engineering scenario targeting someone in your department. Identify the psychological principles the attacker is exploiting and how you would counter each one."}'
),
('Pretexting and Baiting', 'social_engineering', 20, 2,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"What Is Pretexting?","body":"Pretexting involves fabricating a scenario (a ''pretext'') to manipulate a victim into revealing information or taking an action. Classic examples include impersonating IT support asking for a password to ''fix an urgent issue'', or posing as an auditor requesting access to financial systems."},{"title":"Baiting Attacks","body":"Baiting relies on curiosity or greed. Physical baiting uses USB drives labelled ''Payroll Q4'' left in car parks or reception areas, knowing curious employees will plug them in. Digital baiting offers free software downloads or prize notifications that install malware. Never plug in found USB devices."}],"summary_prompt":"You find a USB drive in the company car park labelled ''Executive Salaries 2024''. Describe every step you would take, explaining the security reasoning behind each decision."}'
),
('Protecting Personal Information', 'social_engineering', 15, 3,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Your Digital Footprint","body":"Publicly available information — LinkedIn profiles, social media posts, company websites, public records — is the primary reconnaissance resource for social engineers. Oversharing your role, projects, travel plans, or organisational structure makes targeted attacks far easier."},{"title":"Limiting Exposure","body":"Audit your privacy settings on all social platforms annually. Avoid posting about internal projects, system names, or organisational changes publicly. Be cautious about accepting connections from unknown people on professional networks — attackers build rapport over weeks before striking."}],"summary_prompt":"Conduct a mock audit of your own public digital footprint. List what information an attacker could find and propose three specific steps to reduce your exposure."}'
),
('Verification Protocols', 'social_engineering', 15, 4,
 '{"sections":[{"title":"Always Verify Identity","body":"Never perform a sensitive action — transferring funds, resetting a password, granting access — based solely on an email or phone call, even if it appears to come from a senior executive. Attackers specifically impersonate authority figures to trigger compliance. Always verify through a separate, pre-established channel."},{"title":"Building a Verification Culture","body":"Establish a company-wide call-back verification procedure for any out-of-band request involving money, credentials, or data. Make it culturally safe to question requests, even from senior staff. Publish and rehearse verification protocols so employees default to them under pressure."}],"summary_prompt":"Write a verification protocol for your team to follow whenever someone (internal or external) requests access to sensitive systems or data via phone or email."}'
